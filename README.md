# Description

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (South Australia) Incorporated (RSPCA) required a system to assist its legal counsel to prepare Information and Summons documents. Completing the Information and Summons and related South Australian Magistrates Court forms can be time consuming and inefficient.  

The app will simplify data entry and where appropriate automate data input based on selections made in the app to reduce administrative burden. By using the app, the user will only need to add values once to populate the desired forms. 

The app is able to produce draft South Australian Magistrates Court Forms 2, 3, 8 and 23, and the Summary of Facts, to be downloaded in Microsoft Word for review and finalising.
